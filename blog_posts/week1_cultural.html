        <h3>Fireside Chat Video</h3>
         <p>
         The fireside chat video made me realize that a part of me did resonate with having the "restaurant" mindset of just showing up and expecting good things to happen automatically as thing progressed in the course. I couldn't be more wrong. The first week of Phase 0 totally kicked my ass. I was challenged in every way possible. Being completely new to html and CSS, I found myself struggling to learn the material at a fast pace while still completing what is required of me. Plus, it really doesn't help that I have a full time job to deal with as well. I felt defeated yesterday when I realized that I was way behind some of my cohort classmates and I thought that maybe I wasn't good enough for this course. Shereef's encouraging thoughts helped me to feel less anxious and more optimistic about what I am going through as I continue to adapt to the coursework. The video showed me that no matter how far others seem to be ahead of me, we are basically still on the same train, and that there is no shame in asking for help because by doing so, you are admitting to yourself that you are stuck and there is still more for you to learn. By the end of the video, I felt more committed to DBC and less intimidated by everything.
