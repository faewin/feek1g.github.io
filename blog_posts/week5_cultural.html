        <h3> What is Pair Programming?</h3>
        <p>
          Pair programming is a software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer, pointer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.
        </p>
        <h3>How has it effected me?</h3>
        <p>
          It has allowed me to communicate better. Being able to communicate ideas clearly is not only important in code, but also when working directly with others. When you communicate effectively you can solve challenges with more ease.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally pairing has also taught me to be more patient. No one likes to be rushed. When you take time to slow down and take time to discuss your game plan or ideas together, the solution naturally follows.<br><br>

          Although I was initially worried about  pair programming because I'm an introvert who usually prefers working alone. I have learned a great deal of techniques, and it has helped me grow as a person. I have seen first hand how effective pair programming can be, and  looking forward to my future pairings to develop my craft in programming.
