        <h3> Sterotype Threat</h3>
        <p>
          Sociologist Robert K. Merton came up with the term "self-fulfilling prophecy" to describe the phenomenon of an expectation about a situation or event that affects an individual's behavior in such a manner that it causes that expectation to be fulfilled. Growing up in a predominantly Hispanic environment in the city of Eagle Pass, Texas, I observed the stereotypical expectations that seemed to prevail around my family and peers. For instance, I was not expected to achieve straight As at school because it was normal for a "Mexican" to get Bs and Cs. Thus, I never gave myself the opportunity to give my studies my all and I got by with mediocre grades.

          When I graduated from high-school, college was the last thing on my mind. My Hispanic friends were more interested in getting a minimum wage job at the local grocery store. It was the norm. Mexicans do not need to go to college and get a well-paying job. That was what I understood from the world that I was living in. As long as I had enough money to pay the bills and split rent with a couple of other people, I will be fine. And because none of my family had ever gone college with some not even graduating high school, I felt like the same would apply to me. It wasn't until I met my wife (who at that point in time was pursuing her bachelors), that for the first time in my life, I started to think about achieving more with my life. I wanted a career that I loved, not something that was just there to pay the bills. I wanted to challenge myself and show my Hispanic friends and family that the stereotypes we had put on ourselves were the only thing that was standing in the way of our success.

          When my mother in law offered the opportunity to be able to study in Dev boot camp, it felt like a dream come true. It was a second chance for me to renew myself and become the person I always dreamt of being. For me, Dev boot camp is not just a course, but a stepping stone into the life I always wanted. These last two months have been the most frustrating, but happiest times of my life. I have never wanted to succeed more badly that right now.

          However, being the first in my family to step out of the stereotypical trap has not been that easy. There have been some days where I doubted myself and my ability to follow through with Phase 0 because I was working a full-time job at the same time. The realization that I have a hard road ahead to achieve my dreams can be overwhelming. Whenever I feel this way, I give myself time to relax and meditate as I reiterate my goals for the near future. This always helps to rejuvenate me and bring me back to a positive mindset.
