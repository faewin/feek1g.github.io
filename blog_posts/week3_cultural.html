        <h3> Thinking Style</h3>
        <p>
          After taking the assessment my thinking style came to be Abstract Sequential. Which  made a lot of sense because I'm the type of person who  analyzes a  situation, before making a decision.  Additionally I apply logic in solving or finding solutions to problems.  The best way to learn for this thinking style is by having access to experts and references, working alone, and being places in a stimulating environment. Which resonated with me because I usually prefer to work alone, and when stuck I prefer to look over online resources and if that fails I ask the community for assistance.  I feel my thinking style helps me here at DBC, because I pay a lot of attention to the details when I'm programming, as well take advantage of my cohort by asking questions when I'm stumped. At the moment the biggest trouble for in Phase 0 is time management, because I work a full time and lost my vehicle recently, it's really hard for me to cope with everything. But that has not discouraged me one bit, in week 2 I took advantage of learning more about meditation, and I apply it everyday to reduce the stress in my life. Another technique that has been helping me is the “Pomodoro Technique” and I study for 25minutes and then take a breather for 5 minutes then go back to work.

        <h3>Growth and Fixed Mindset</h3>
        <p>
          I have to admit when I started DBC, I had somewhat of a fixed mindset. I expected  the course work to be easy but then came week one, and all of a sudden my eyes were open. I felt overwhelmed by the challenges and was considering this course was not for me. Then I went back and rewatched the video about Growth and Fixed mindset and realized I had a choice and I decided to embrace the challenge. And here I am 3 weeks later, and still going strong. That being said now I put all my effort in a challenge, and  see criticism as a stepping stone for me to improve on.
