        <h3> Technology is constantly changing.</h3>
        <p>
          Every year a new device comes out, and this can vary from laptops to mobile devices. Consumers are always looking for the new shiny toy. Simply put, people want to get the latest gadgets. Which causes companies and their employees to push forward with new innovative ideas, and huge demand for software to be made for this gadgets.

          That being said there are new languages, frameworks, development tool, etc. being created all the time. Which makes the tech industry feel more like a roller coaster. As a new programmer I struggle deciding what I should learn first, and even then you can run the risk of having the technologies you learned to be phased out in a couple of years, by something more superior. This can be a huge problem because people may fear the skill-set they worked so hard to obtain can totally go out the window in a couple of years. Which may cause developers to think they'll never keep up with the consumer/market demands.
        </p>
        <h3>So what can we do about it?</h3>
        <p>
          Just jump in! Lets face it the technology is always changing, but instead of worrying about what language to learn first? Worry about what concepts you need to understand. New languages are always coming out, and constantly changing, but these languages are based on previous code,concepts, and high level of knowledge.
