        <h3> How do computers work? </h3>
        <p>
          Well for the most part when you do a daily task such as checking your email, going to Facebook or watching a movie, multiple things are happening. But its mostly a combination of hardware, software and input.
        </p>
        <h3> What is Hardware?</h3>
        <p>
          Great question! Hardware can vary from monitors, keyboards, printer and mouse, but what we really want is the good stuff inside your computer that is all synchronized and working together such as motherboard, ram, and the most important part, the CPU. The hardware processes the commands it receives from the software to perform task or operations.
        </p>
        <h3> What is Software?</h3>
        <p>
          Software are just programs, and there are different types of programs. For example there are operating system software such as Ubuntu Linux, Maverick OSX, or Windows 7. Additionally, there is application software, such as Skype, Google Chrome, or any popular games and tools that we download on a daily basis.
        </p>
        <h3> How do they work together?</h3>
        <p>
          Okay, so we know that the software are just programs that communicate to the hardware to perform daily tasks, and operations. But at the end of the day, a computer is basically nothing without someone to navigate it and tell it what to do. We have to provide the input to command the computer do something. For example, when you double click on the Skype icon, you are executing the software to communicate with the hardware to open the application named Skype. The application will then open and, you will ask the computer to perform the next action and so forth.
