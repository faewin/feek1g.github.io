       <h3> JavaScript Popularity</h3>
        <p>
          One of the most popular languages in web development is JavaScript. The reason being is because it has evolved to enable web developers to produce vivid web pages. Not only that, but it's a lightweight package taking up little room as possible, and yet providing amazing results. Additionally, JavaScript is one of the languages that lets you manipulate the HTML content using Document Object Model (DOM) which is crucial for improving the web page. Another great benefit is that you can use JavaScript and its libraries across different browsers, and it will work great.
        </p>
        <h3>JavaScript Pros and Cons</h3>
        <p>
          One of pros of JavaScript is that it uses client side execution. This means that it uses the resources of the users computer to perform tasks instead of sending a request to the server and having to wait for a response. Which in return uses less bandwidth from the server, and takes advantage of the client's computer to do tasks. Another great thing about JavaScript is that it's always being updated, this allows it to do amazing tasks despite its small package.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, there are some cons with JavaScript. For example, its security, because someone can configure a script to make websites do stuff that you don't want to such as opening pop ups, changing the size of the window or disabling you from right-clicking on the web page. Another con that comes to mind is that although it supports multiple browsers, some clients won't have their browsers updated to the most current version, or might contain a certain feature which may cause unexpected bugs.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a brilliant language to develop great web pages or applications. Best of all, the libraries are always being updated which shows great promise that it will still continue to be relevant in the future. Although the language is harder to understand compared to Ruby, It was a great learning experience.
