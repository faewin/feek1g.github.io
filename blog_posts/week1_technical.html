      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank"><h3>Youtube</h3></a>

      <p><img src="http://tinyurl.com/byol4fr" alt="Youtube icon" class="img-code-small">Is one of my favorite websites to visit often, YouTube at the moment is the largest video sharing site on the Web. 
      </p>
      <p>The moment you log into your account, the page is filled with recommended videos based on what you've watched recently. The best way I can describe YouTube is that it's simple, and although it lacks color, and graphics the content it has is almost limitless. Once logged in you click the on the search bar which is conveniently located in the top left with an icon of a magnifying glass, which makes it very easy to spot and search for videos of your liking. </p>
      <p>YouTube, for me has always been my trusted advisor. When I find myself stuck on a problem or needing guidance. I can always search for videos directly related to what I'm having problems which can vary from cooking recipes to learning how to code, and a few seconds I'll have a page full of tutorials. At the same time It can also provide you with lots of fun entertainment from watching comedians to movies.</p>
      <p>Although this website is very useful, and you can spend hours on it before noticing it does have a drawback. YouTube, is a business and although it doesn't directly sell anything to the user they make most of their money from ads. These ad's start at the beginning of every video and can vary from ten seconds to a minute which can be very annoying at times </p>

      <a href="http://www.cnn.com/" target="_blank"><h3>CNN</h3></a>
      <p><img src="http://tinyurl.com/q4lhjjx" alt="CNN icon" class="img-code-small">Is another website I enjoy coming to often. I love CNN because is among one of the best websites for online news and information delivery.</p>
      <p>I usually come to CNN to read about US headlines, and keep up with the latest tech news and gadgets. The first thing I notice when I enter the website is the bright red banner which has CNN's logo. Then on the banner it has all the popular news feeds, followed by links of popular news genres. Right below on the center of the page, they have their top story with big headlines, which makes it very simple to spot, and it provides great illustration with pictures giving the website more appeal. Although the website is a bit cluttered, everything is neatly organized</p>
      <p>The website is very easy to use, and everything you need is mostly one click away. Like YouTube, CNN provides a great search bar located on the top right which can be used to find articles and recent news regarding whatever you may have in mind. One of the things that separate CNN from other websites, is that it allows you to actually place comments below an article, and read what other people think of it. </p>
      <p>CNN does sell a service called "CNN Newswatch" which provides live-breaking news for your TV service, or mobile device. The cost is $1 for the fist three months then $44.96 for the next nine months. Like YouTube, CNN also make money of online ads. I typically just spend 30 minutes on this website to see what's new then leave so I don't really need the subscription feature. </p>

      <a href="http://www.amazon.com" target="_blank"><h3>Amazon</h3></a>
      <p><img src="http://tinyurl.com/pqah7f6" alt="Amazon icon" class="img-code-small">Is my number one to go place to buy items, and compare prices. I love surfing on Amazon because as a Prime member I get the ability to watch free TV shows, and media that compares to that of NetFlix. I also get priority two-day shipping on all of my items, and get free e-books on my Kindle device. </p>
      <p>The moment you visit the website there is huge search bar which is located right in the middle of your screen, which makes it very simple to find items. Then you can additionally filter your search which lets you sort the item in question by popularity, price, reviews, and much more. This really helps me as a consumer because it allows me to read feedback from other buyers and even ask questions before I commit in buying. </p>
      <p>Another great thing is Amazon does right, is have daily sales specials on items. Which immediately catches my focus, and makes me want to visit back more often to look at their deal. I often feel like time flies, because they provide so much content in music,videos, e-books, and great discounts on items. </p>
      <p>Amazon does sell prime membership which cost $99.99 for one year, and provides a lot of great perks like free shipping, and media content. As a Prime member I would definitely recommend getting it.</p>
