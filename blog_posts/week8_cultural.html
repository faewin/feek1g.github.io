        <h3> Dealing with Conflict</h3>
        <p>
          The biggest emotional conflict I had involved the two people that I cared for the most. In 2012, I married my soulmate, my girlfriend of 3 years. Although we had a lot in common, fundamentally we came from completely different cultural and family backgrounds. When my Hispanic family found out that I was planning on marrying a Chinese woman from Asia, they tried every single way they could to change my decision. My mother was the main instigator of this. When she first started to show her disapproval of my wife, I was in complete denial. My wife would tell me how uncomfortable she felt when my mom did or said a certain thing and I would just tell her that it’s just how my mom is and she does not mean anything bad by it. I did not want to believe that my mother was actually trying to undermine my relationship with my wife.
        </p>
        <p>
          The conflict escalated and blew out of proportion when my mother showed up to my apartment unannounced one day while I was at work. My wife was terrified of having to deal with my mother by herself so she hid in the room while my mother knocked on the door. When I came home, I found a note on our door from my mother asking me to call her because it was an emergency. My wife prompted me to give her a call in case it was something serious. After a distressing 2 hour long phone call with my mother, I realized that I could no longer be in denial about my mom’s negative feelings towards my wife. She basically spent two hours on the phone berating my wife and voicing her clear disapproval towards our marriage. She also spent the next few weeks stalking us at our home, leaving me guilt-tripping messages on my door, my car. She even followed me to work. I was completely overwhelmed and I did not know how to deal with her anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          After researching about the compass of shame, I realize that I have a tendency towards avoidance. When confronted with conflict, I tend to put myself in denial and pretend that nothing ever happened. It has always been my method of coping with negative feelings and it worked great for me because I could still get along with everyone even though deep down inside, I know that I am not being honest about my feelings and I am not resolving anything. My mother on the other hand, deals with her conflicts by attacking others. She plays the victim with her guilt trips and when that fails, she lashes out and goes to the extreme.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I could no longer be in denial about my mom’s negative feelings towards my wife, I changed my conflict strategy from Avoidance to Withdrawal. I cut off not only my mother but my entire extended family from my life. It was too hard for me to deal with confronting them about the horrible things they were saying about my wife and our marriage. So I chose to be isolated from them out of fear that they will try to continue to make me feel guilty and ashamed for marrying someone that they did not approve of.
        </p>
        <p>
          It has been a whole year since I saw my mother and the rest of my family. While this has prevented any conflicts because I am essentially ignoring them, it does not make me happy. There have been many occasions where I wished that I had handle the conflict better so that I could still be a part of my family.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I could go back in time, I would have confronted my family from the very first moment they insulted my wife in front of me. I would have told them that if they cared about me, they would respect my decision to marry my wife. I would have told them that I never wanted to hear them speak badly about my wife again because by disrespecting her, they were disrespecting me as well. I would have set proper boundaries with my mother beforehand so that she would not have showed up at my house unannounced in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          My wife deals with conflict by withdrawing and hiding from others. I believe that when she first sensed that my family disliked her, she withdrew from them and did not want to open up to them. Perhaps my family had felt her reluctance to be a part of them and that gave them even more reason to dislike her. If I could go back in time, I would have listened to my wife’s anxieties and fear towards my family and instead of telling her that this is just how my family acts and she needs to get used to it. I would have been there for her every time she felt uncomfortable instead of just expecting her to get used to it. Thinking back, she was completely out of her comfort zone and perhaps if I had showed her a little more support, she would not have been so afraid to deal with my mom alone when my mom had showed up at our home.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I have learnt from this experience is that avoidance and withdrawal are not healthy ways to cope with conflict. They do not resolve anything, they only make things worse. I wish that I had the courage to face my fears and conflicts instead.
