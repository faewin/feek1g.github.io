        <h3> Asking Questions</h3>
        <p>
          I have definitely been a victim of asking poor or bad questions. As a complete beginner to programming, It was hard for me to ask questions when I’m not even sure on how to phrase it to begin with.  
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the best things you can do when asking your question is by showing your code and being very clear about what you want to achieve. Additionally, providing picture illustrations such as snippets of your code or pseudo code will help the reader to understand and have a better visulazation of your program.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last thing you want to do when you submit your question is to proof read it. Being dyslexic, I have a tendency to repeat words in a sentence or have typos without even noticing it at all. I have to make it a point to proof read anything I type at least twice to ensure that the reader could comprehend what I’m trying to say.
