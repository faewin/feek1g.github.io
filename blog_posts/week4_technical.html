        <h3> What is an Array?</h3>
        <p>
          Well in simplest terms an array is just a list of items in order. We use arrays to store a "collection of items".In Ruby, an array is created by using the left-bracket and right-bracket. Lets a create a basic array:
          <img src="http://oi62.tinypic.com/zlspe8.jpg" alt="picture of code" class="img-code"><br>
          This array has four elements. Each element is an integer, and is separated by commas from its neighboring elements. Elements can be accessed by their index. To access a particular element, an array is followed by the index contained within square brackets. For example:
          <img src="http://oi60.tinypic.com/2emhb3o.jpg" alt="picture of code" class="img-code"><br>
          The indexing in Ruby starts from 0, so the first element of an array is element 0, and so forth. In this example x[2] was calling the third element of the array. <br><br>
          To wrap it up arrays are used to store collections of data, and each object in an array can be accessed by using a unique key (index of element). The positioning of an array starts at "0".
        </p>
        <h3>What is a Hash?</h3>
        <p>
          Well like an array, hashes are also used to store data. However, hashes have a different storage format and way to define each object within a collection.  Additionally hashes are given a key to point to them, which makes them more like a dictionary than a list. For example:
          <img src="http://oi59.tinypic.com/33ur2qa.jpg" alt="picture of code" class="img-code"><br>
          The variable storing the hash is dictionary, and it contains four entries which you can prove with the code below:
          <img src="http://oi57.tinypic.com/okr81d.jpg" alt="picture of code" class="img-code"><br>
          To wrap things up Hashes store data as well, but act more like a dictionary. To access an element you use a key  to point to them.
        </p>
        <h3> How to pick between an array or a hash?</h3>
        <p>
          Well that really depends on what kind of data you want to store in your collection.  For example a teacher might want to save her lucky lottery numbers which she can do by creating an array like so:
          <img src="http://oi57.tinypic.com/2hhgkl0.jpg" alt="picture of code" class="img-code"><br>
          And, just like that we saved the lucky numbers under the variable lottery_numbers.  Now lets say the following day she graded her students papers and wants to store the data, at this point creating a Hash would be recommended because you can easily access the data using 
          a key which in this case is the students name.For Example:
          <img src="http://oi58.tinypic.com/nexkyt.jpg" alt="picture of code" class="img-code"><br>
