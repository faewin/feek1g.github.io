        <h3> Personal Values</h3>
        <p>
          The value that corresponds to my happiest and most fulfilled moment would have to be achievement. I am competitive by nature and I thrive on challenging myself to accomplish the goals I have set forth. I get a deep sense of satisfaction when I am able to overcome a problem that once seemed impossible. Achievement is something that everyone strives to attain in their lives. It gives us a sense of purpose, something to work for and it molds us into a better person. It helps me to stay focus on the present while looking forward to the future because I know that all the effort and hard work I am putting in right now will bring me one step closer to achieving success.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lets take Dev Bootcamp for example, as a complete beginner in programming I feel the most fulfilled when I’m able to complete the learning competencies for the week, and something that was once felt impossible to understand is now becoming second nature to me. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Achievement by definition is something done successfully by effort, courage, and skill. Before you can achieve something, you have to first invest your time and energy into it. For me, every time I achieve a goal that was challenging to accomplish, it feels like I’m leaving behind the stereotype of “not being good enough”. Of course that doesn’t mean I always get what I want, I have moments where I feel completely overwhelmed and defeated by the challenge. And what I do to overcome this is by meditating, and practicing mindfulness thinking.
