DOM is an amazing tool! I love how it automatically organizes your HTML into a tree structure making it easy to navigate through you code. Plus the ability to also add, modify or delete elements or content so easily makes it awesome.

I loved Chrome web tools! They were very confusing to use at first, but now that I'm getting a grasp on it. I'm noticing improvement I can make in my previous webpages thanks to the real time modifications.

When I compared my webpage to thats of wordpress I noticed they had many lines of codes using JavaScript.

I found the Chrome web tool to be very helpful!

I found a great Youtube video that showed useful things you can do with Chrome web tools:
