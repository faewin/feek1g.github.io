# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Web standards are good because it enforces that webpages has valid code (Html,Css,Javascript) and meets accessibility.

Yes, because it provides guidlines that help improve accessibility searchability, and allow others to understand your code better

Well I think i've gotten used to using div, but yes I can see the appeal and how better it a webpage can be by using more semantic markup

Reset css is neccessary because every browser has a default style sheet, and when you reset the css you put them all in the same baseline, which makes the webpage look the same across all browser platforms.

I used Chrome, and Firefox to experiment. But I have never noticed  that sites looked different depending on browser. Personally I belive all web browsers should be styled the same, but It's one of those things were its easier said than done.
