# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

The biggest time managment challenge I face right now is juggling a full time job and having to find the time, and energy everyday to study for phase 0. Another issue is that I recently lost my car, and it takes so much time for me to get simple things done like shopping for groceries, something that once took 30-45 minutes, now takes me 2 hours with public transport.

My plan to combat this challenge will be by practicing meditation to get rid of stress, and to stay focused on my studies. I also plan to practice the pomodoro technique, and focus intensively then take a 5 minutes breather. My overall plan is study the most I can with my limited during the week, and work my ass off during the weekend.
