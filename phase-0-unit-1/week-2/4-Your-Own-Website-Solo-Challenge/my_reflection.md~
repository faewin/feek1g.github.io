Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I learned that you can't just jump in and build a webpage. You need to to factor in the basic rules of web design such as Information gathering. Like what is the purpose of the website? What do you want to gain from the website? Whom do you want to target? Then you will plan how you want your website and build a wireframe, and finally develope it. But you're not out of the woods yet, you still have to take account for testing, and maintance. Then comes User experience, which is how a user feels about the website.

I had fun working on site, and I managed to make alot of changes. But, due to time restraints at work I didn't get to complete my ideal wireframe design, but im looking forward to this week to add more content to my page.

My process was really simple. I made a wireframe of what I wanted and then I started coding and messing with the Chrome Dev Tools, and modified the webpage to my liking.

I would like to learn how to add flash videos, and made picture slides like on Amazon websites. I will create a left side bar with popular media sites like facebook and twitter.

It was difficult for me to apply everything I learned this week, because I had a crazy week at work and had mandatory overtime, but I'm looking forward to this week to practice more on my CSS.

I found our community to be very helpful. They provided great links for this weeks curriculum.
