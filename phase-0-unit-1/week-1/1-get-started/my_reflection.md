## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

I didn’t have any trouble setting up my Git, and Github. The directions were very easy to follow, and I learned how to use terminal, but most of all I learned the main difference between Git and Github.

Git is a version control software that works locally in your computer. It keeps track of your files, and remembers changes made and when you made them. Additionally it provides the security of knowing you can roll-back to a previous version in the event that there is a bug in your work, or if you don’t like the new changes made. Git also allows you to create branches which lets you create multiple copies of the original file, and lets you modify each of them to your liking and when you finally find a version that works best for you keep it.

On the other hand, Github lives remotely  on the internet and is a hosting service for Git repositories similar to a cloud. Which in short allow developers to share their code or files remotely and collaborate on projects at the same time. It makes sense that developers will use git because it allows them to collaborate in a project without stepping on each others toes.

I’m still confused on how to actually use git as far as the commands and how they are used, but I’m sure the more I play with Git, the more I’ll come to a better understanding of it.
