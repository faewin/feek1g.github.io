## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I learned that the internet and the web are not the same thing. The internet is a system of computer networks that communicate to each other with specific rules, and the web is an application made from the internet. I also learned that a webpage is actually like a home address, except instead of using street names and what not, they use unique IP addresses.
 
Some important things to remember when setting up your HTML website is to make sure it has Web Accessibility. This means that people with disabilities will be able to perceive, understand, and navigate the webpage. Another thing to consider is the design of your website. It should be visually appealing and easy to navigate through.
 
I felt excited when I saw my page live! I couldn't believe that just one line of html code was enough to build a webpage. I'm looking forward to learning more about HTML so I can add more content.
 
Yes, I'm still having 'Aha' moments when learning about GIT, but I am getting better at understanding the concepts as I continue to learn. For example, I got to practice more with GIT after I cloned the repository curriculum from Dev Boot camp to my computer using the terminal and I feel like this helped to deepen my understanding with GIT.  

Well, I used Google and YouTube for extra information. But I do have to say that learning from http://skillcrush.com/ was nice. The information was perfectly clear and very easy to digest.
