## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Coding HTML made sense because some of the element tags are directly abbreviated from English. For example bold is "<b></b>" or paragraph is "<p></p>". Some things that didn't make sense were attributes, but as I kept practicing they started to make more sense.

Although HTML was very easy to read, and understand. It was very tedious adding an opening tag and closing tag for almost every element.

I felt that by the end of this lesson, I had a better understanding on how attributes worked, and because of that I was able to add more visual appeal to my webpage.
