Blog url: <!-- Blog URL here (remove comment)  -->

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I really enjoyed making this blog, because I really had to stop and think about what really attracts me, and grabs my attention to the websites I visit in my daily life. The blog also helped in the sense of reading code and writing code, and the best part was that it didn't feel like an assignment because It was about webpages I love to visit.
