I struggled with the CSS part of this challenge, but with the help of a book I was able to get through it. Book -> HTML and CSS by Jon Duckett

I was having trouble with the the CSS rules, but with more practice I was able to get the gist of it. I'm still confused on how margins and padding works, but with time I will master these concepts.

I LEARNED ALOT about HTML and CSS! Although the work didnt seem so bad, it was really hard to keep up with a full time job, but it was all worth it in the end! :)

I enjoyed the part when everything was over, and taking a step back and realizing that I had created a cool webpage with no experience in the HTML/CSS.

I found CSS very tedious to learn.
