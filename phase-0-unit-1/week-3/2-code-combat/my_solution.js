	What is this referring to? Think programming-wise rather than in the terms of the game.

	'this' is a reference to the current object whose method is being called on.

	What does the () do in JavaScript?

	The paranthesis are used to call a function, which may or may not have parameters inside.

	What is the point of the semicolons?

	Like C, the semicolon is used to end a statement in JS. And, a statement is a piece of code
	that tells the computer what to do.
