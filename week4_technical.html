				<h2> What is an Array?</h2><br>
				<p>
					Well in simplest terms an array is just a list of items in order. We use arrays to store a "collection of items".In Ruby, an array is created by using the left-bracket and right-bracket. Lets a create a basic array:
					<br>
					<br>
					<img src="http://oi62.tinypic.com/zlspe8.jpg">
				</p>
				<p> 
					<br>
					This array has four elements. Each element is an integer, and is separated by commas from its neighboring elements. Elements can be accessed by their index. To access a particular element, an array is followed by the index contained within square brackets. For example:
					<br>
					<br> 
					<img src="http://oi60.tinypic.com/2emhb3o.jpg">
					<br>
					<br>
					The indexing in Ruby starts from 0, so the first element of an array is element 0, and so forth. In this example x[2] was calling the third element of the array. <br>
					To wrap it up arrays are used to store collections of data, and each object in an array can be accessed by using a unique key (index of element). The positioning of an array starts at "0".
 				</p>
 				<h2>What is a Hash?</h2>
 				<p>
 					Well like an array, hashes are also used to store data. However, hashes have a different storage format and way to define each object within a collection.  Additionally hashes are given a key to point to them, which makes them more like a dictionary than a list. For example:<br><br>
 					<img src="http://oi59.tinypic.com/33ur2qa.jpg"><br><br>
 					The variable storing the hash is dictionary, and it contains four entries which you can prove with the code below:<br><br>
 					<img src="http://oi57.tinypic.com/okr81d.jpg"><br><br>
 					To wrap things up Hashes store data as well, but act more like a dictionary. To access an element you use a key  to point to them.
 				</p>
 				<h2> How to pick between an array or a hash?</h2>
 				<p>
 					Well that really depends on what kind of data you want to store in your collection.  For example a teacher might want to save her lucky lottery numbers which she can do by creating an array like so:<br><br>
 					<img src="http://oi57.tinypic.com/2hhgkl0.jpg"><br><br>
 					And, just like that we saved the lucky numbers under the variable lottery_numbers.  Now lets say the following day she graded her students papers and wants to store the data, at this point creating a Hash would be recommended because you can easily access the data using 
 					a key which in this case is the students name.For Example:<br><br>
